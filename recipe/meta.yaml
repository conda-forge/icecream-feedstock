  summary: |
    Never use print() to debug again; inspect variables, expressions,
    and program execution with a single, simple function call.

  description: |
    Do you ever use print() or log() to debug your code? Of course you do.
    IceCream, or ic for short, makes print debugging a little sweeter.

    ic() is like print(), but better:

    1. It prints both expressions/variable names and their values.
    2. It's 40% faster to type.
    3. Data structures are pretty printed.
    4. Output is syntax highlighted.
    5. It optionally includes program context: filename, line number, and parent function.
